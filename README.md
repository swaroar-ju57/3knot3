* **Progression:** Levels will be designed to gradually increase in difficulty, introducing new enemies, challenges, and narrative elements that escalate the intensity of the war.
* **Key Locations:** Levels will feature historically significant locations and landmarks relevant to the 1971 war and the actions of the individual Bir Sreshtho.
