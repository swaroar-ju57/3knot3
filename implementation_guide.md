# Map Dots Implementation Guide

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create the Dot Prefab
1. Create a new UI Image in your project (Right-click in Hierarchy > UI > Image)
2. Set the image shape to circle and color to red
3. Add the `LocationDot.cs` script to this image
4. Make sure the RectTransform is properly set up (e.g., with anchors at the center)
5. Make this a prefab by dragging it to your Prefabs folder

### 2. Create Map Container
1. Create a new UI Image or RectTransform to serve as the map container
2. Position it appropriately in your UI layout
3. This will be where your map is displayed and where the dots will be placed

### 3. Set Up LocationMapDots Component
1. Create an empty GameObject in your scene
2. Add the `LocationMapDots.cs` script to it
3. Assign the Map Container to the `_mapContainer` field
4. Assign your Dot Prefab to the `_dotPrefab` field
5. Adjust other settings as needed (sizes, colors, animation duration)

### 4. Connect to LocationCarousel
1. Assign the LocationMapDots component to the `_mapDots` field in your LocationCarousel

### 5. Update LocationData
1. For each of your location data objects, set the `mapPosition` vector to define where on the map the dot should appear
2. The positions are in UI coordinates relative to the map container

## How It Works
- When the carousel initializes, it will create dots for each location
- As you navigate through the carousel, the corresponding dot will be highlighted
- When a carousel item is selected, its dot will grow larger
- The system uses DoTween for smooth animations

## Important Notes
- Make sure the map container's RectTransform is properly set up with anchors and pivot points
- The positions of dots are relative to the map container's RectTransform
- You may need to adjust the dot sizes and colors based on your specific UI design
- The animation timing can be adjusted in the LocationMapDots component
